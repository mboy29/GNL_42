This project consists of creating a program that opens a file and reads a line ending with a carriage return ('\n'). Recalling the function of the same file will read the following line.

A (-1) is returned if an error occurred. A (0) is returned if the file is finished reading. And a (1) is returned if a line is read.

This project aims at understanding memory allocation. This is to say, how to allocate memory whiles preventing leaks and learning when and how to free correctly.
